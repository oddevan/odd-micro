The unholy love-child of synthpop and hip-hop.

Sometimes the only way up is to grow. Sometimes the questions need to be asked of ourselves. Sometimes we stand firm,
and others we admit our wanderlust. Sometimes the only way to say something is to sing it. And sometimes the only way to
sing is to rap. Or use copious amounts of <del>AutoTune&trade;</del> <ins>pitch correction</ins>.

My music project I've had going since high school. Long enough to go from "Christian Rap" to "No, not like that." Every
so often I'll pull something off the shelf long enough to release it.
