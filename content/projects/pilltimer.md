Stop counting hours and doses and just take your medicine.

An iOS/iPadOS app to track ad-hoc medicine doses. Compares doses over the last 24 hours to the label instructions and
gives a clear “yes”/“wait” instruction for each medication. No ads, no data collection.

The pill icons were created by [Andrew Ramos](https://andrewramos.com). The first versions were written in Objective-C
and used Core Data for data storage. Version 3 was a ground-up rewrite in Swift and SwiftUI that used iCloud for data
sync. The app is a free download that tracks one medication; multiple medications can be unlocked for a one-time $3 USD
purchase.
