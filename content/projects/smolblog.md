Social media is just blogging. So let’s make a blog that’s as easy and fun as social media built on an open platform we
control.

Start with an adaptable core. Connect to other sites as channels. Create in a simple, mobile-friendly interface. Publish
to your website, the fediverse, and your social media all at once from one canonical source. Own your online identity
and escape from decaying platforms.

The Smolblog logo was created by Joshua Blankenship via his [LogoLand][ll] venture. The backend is being written in PHP
using a smattering of PSR-standard interfaces, exclusively outputs in a RESTful API, and is piggybacking on
[WordPress][wp] (for now). The frontend is a progressive web app written in [Svelte][svelte].

The product is not quite ready to demo, owing to a combination of burnout and shifting priorities, but you can [browse
the product roadmap][roadmap]. I'm currently working on a short video essay about the project.
